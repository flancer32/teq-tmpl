# @flancer32/teq-tmpl

A universal package for managing and rendering text templates in Node.js applications with support for multilingualism and flexible overrides. Enables easy creation of localized content for web pages, email campaigns, and any other text-based formats.

---

## Key Features

* **Multilingual Support**  
  Automatic template selection considering user, application, and plugin locales with fallback logic.

* **Flexible Override System**  
  Allows overriding plugin templates at the application level without modifying the original code.

* **Template Engine Abstraction**  
  Supports various engines (Mustache, Nunjucks, etc.) through a unified interface, with an easily extensible architecture.

* **Versatility**  
  Suitable for generating HTML, JSON, XML, YAML, email, and other text formats.

* **Easy Integration**  
  Easily integrates with any Node.js application and can be used as a standalone module.

## How It Works (Briefly)

1. Defines the target template considering type (web, email, text), name, package, and locales.
2. Searches the template file in a strict order based on locales and overrides.
3. Loads the found template from disk.
4. Renders the template with data via the configured engine.
5. Returns the ready localized content.

## Integration Requirements

When using this package, the application **must implement the interface `Fl32_Tmpl_Back_Api_Adapter`**. This adapter interface declares a method `getEngine()` that returns an instance of a template engine conforming to the interface `Fl32_Tmpl_Back_Api_Engine`.

The application is responsible for configuring which template engine implementation to use by specifying dependencies in the project's `package.json`. The `getEngine()` method can return one of the available engine implementations provided by the package:

- `Fl32_Tmpl_Back_Service_Engine_Mustache`
- `Fl32_Tmpl_Back_Service_Engine_Nunjucks`
- `Fl32_Tmpl_Back_Service_Engine_Simple`

Alternatively, the application can implement its own custom template engine, provided it satisfies the `Fl32_Tmpl_Back_Api_Engine` interface.

This design ensures maximal flexibility and decouples the package from specific template engine dependencies, which are managed by the consuming application.

## Who Benefits

* Developers building multilingual web applications and mailing services.
* Teams working with plugins and complex modular architectures.
* Projects needing a flexible and extensible template system without lock-in to a specific templating engine.

## Testing

Run unit tests with Node.js built-in runner:

```bash
npm test
```

## Status and Documentation

The package is actively developed and successfully used in projects with modular architecture. It is created following the **TeqFW philosophy**, ensuring clear separation of concerns, modularity, and extensibility. Documentation follows the **3DP methodology**, providing clear structure and separation between code, documentation, and iterations.
